# IOTN 
Grading orthodontic soundness using Computer Vision
This project uses ImageJ in Java to process an intraoral image of a patient's dentition to return their IOTN score.
More about the IOTN score here : http://www.totalorthodontics.co.uk/iotn/

A live demo of this web app is currently hosted at : http://omkarpatil.info/iotn/case.html

A sample report generated after the analysis (which is emailed to the patient) on the doctor's behalf.
